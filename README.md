### What I've learned 

In the Zero To Mastery RoboFriends project, I learned about React components and how they play a vital role in creating web applications. Components in React are like building blocks that you can use to construct different parts of your website. I discovered that by breaking down the user interface into smaller components, it became easier to manage and organize the code. Each component can be designed to handle a specific part of the application, such as a navigation bar or a search box. Components can be reused throught a project, which could save time and effort while ensuring consistency across the website. Ultimately, understanding how to use React components effectively helped me build a well-structured and interactive web application.
