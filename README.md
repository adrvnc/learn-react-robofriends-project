## My Process
### Built with 

- React 18.2.0
- Tachyons  
- CSS 
- JSONPlaceholder fake API 
### What I've learned 

- React is used to build user interfaces using states, components, and props, among other things. Different components serve a unique purpose. They are inside different files but work together to make a project interactive. This approach prevents having one big file for everything, which can be hard to keep track of. 
- To improve upon this project, I've made a small change by implementing a loading screen animation using [this CodePen](https://codepen.io/Freeps2/pen/vYzVKNw).
